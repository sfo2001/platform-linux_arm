pigpio [DEPRECATED - Use lgpio instead]

⚠️  DEPRECATED: pigpio is superseded by lgpio (by same author Joan).

Joan (pigpio author): "pigpio does not work on the Pi 5, I do not think it can
be made to work. lgpio will work."

Why use lgpio instead:
- Works on ALL Pi models (1-5) including Pi 5
- Future-proof (kernel interface)
- Recommended by Raspberry Pi Foundation
- Easier cross-compilation setup

This framework is kept for LEGACY support only. For new projects, use:
    framework = lgpio

If you absolutely need pigpio features (hardware-timed PWM) on Pi ≤4:
    1. Install ARM toolchain: sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
    2. Build from source: https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio
    3. Manual setup required (no automated script provided)

IMPORTANT: pigpio is NOT compatible with Raspberry Pi 5 due to the new RP1 I/O
controller.

Supported boards: Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3, 4, Zero (NOT Pi 5)
