lgpio

lgpio is a modern C library for Linux GPIO access, designed as a successor to
deprecated sysfs GPIO and the pigpio library. It uses the GPIO character device
(/dev/gpiochip*) introduced in Linux kernel 4.8.

lgpio works on ALL Raspberry Pi models (1-5) including Pi 5, which removed
support for older GPIO interfaces.

Supersedes pigpio (by same author Joan) - recommended for all new projects.

Installation for cross-compilation:
    Run: ./scripts/setup-lgpio-cross.sh

    This builds lgpio from source for ARM and installs to:
    $HOME/.local/arm-linux-gnueabihf/

For Raspberry Pi 1 (original models), set environment variable:
    export RPI_LGPIO_REVISION=800012
