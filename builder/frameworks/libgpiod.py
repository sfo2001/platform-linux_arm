libgpiod - Official Linux GPIO Character Device Library

libgpiod is the official userspace library for the Linux kernel GPIO subsystem.
It provides a C API for interacting with GPIO chips via the character device
interface (/dev/gpiochip*) introduced in Linux kernel 4.8.

Architecture:
- Direct ioctl() calls to kernel GPIO character device
- File descriptor-based resource management
- Kernel-enforced GPIO line exclusivity (only one consumer at a time)
- No persistent background threads for basic GPIO operations
- Clean resource cleanup on process exit

Compatibility:
- All Raspberry Pi models (1-5)
- Orange Pi, Rock Pi, Odroid, Banana Pi, NanoPi
- Any Linux SBC with kernel 4.8+ and GPIO chardev driver support
- Portable across architectures (ARM, ARM64, x86)

Key Features:
- Guaranteed exclusive access to GPIO lines (kernel-enforced)
- Request-based API (must claim lines before use)
- Support for input, output, edge detection, bias configuration
- Event monitoring for interrupt-driven applications

Important Notes:
1. GPIO State Persistence: By default, libgpiod may revert GPIO lines to their
   default state when the process exits. On Raspberry Pi, enable persistent
   state by adding to /boot/config.txt:
       dtparam=strict_gpiod

2. API Versions: libgpiod has two major API versions:
   - v1.x (legacy): Simpler API, widely deployed
   - v2.x (modern): More flexible, object-oriented design
   Both are supported; v2.x is recommended for new projects.

3. Comparison with Other Libraries:
   - vs lgpio: libgpiod is kernel-standard, lgpio is RPi-focused with multi-protocol
   - vs pigpio: libgpiod is future-proof, pigpio is Pi 1-4 only (no Pi 5)
   - vs WiringPi: libgpiod is maintained, WiringPi is deprecated

Installation for Cross-Compilation:
    See docs/LIBGPIOD_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.

    Quick start:
    # Install cross-compilation toolchain
    sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf

    # Install libgpiod for target architecture
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libgpiod-dev:armhf

    # Or build from source for custom install location

For Native Compilation (on Raspberry Pi):
    sudo apt install libgpiod-dev gpiod
