WiringPi (GC2 Fork).

WiringPi is a GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835+ used in the
Raspberry Pi. It's designed to be familiar to people who have used the Arduino
"wiring" system.

Originally created by Gordon Henderson (deprecated 2019), now maintained by
the GC2 (Grazer Computer Club) community with Raspberry Pi 5 support.

NOTE: On Pi 5, GCLK functionality is not supported due to RP1 chip documentation
      limitations. For full Pi 5 support, consider using the lgpio framework.

Installation:
    sudo apt install wiringpi

GC2 Fork: https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
Original: http://wiringpi.com (deprecated)
