# GPIO Framework Decision: Dual-Framework Strategy

**Date**: 2025-11-14
**Previous Decision**: lgpio as primary framework (2025-11-09)
**Updated Decision**: Implement **libgpiod** and **lgpio** as dual primary frameworks with complementary strengths

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research and fact-checking, the platform supports **two primary frameworks** with different target use cases:

1. **libgpiod** → Universal Linux standard (all SBCs, system daemons, production)
2. **lgpio** → Raspberry Pi convenience (multi-protocol, rapid development)

Both frameworks work on all Raspberry Pi models including Pi 5. Legacy frameworks (pigpio, WiringPi) remain available but are deprecated.

## Research Methodology

This decision was reached through:
- Analysis of official documentation and whitepapers
- Verification of claims against primary sources
- Community feedback from forums and issue trackers
- Practical testing considerations
- Fact-checking to avoid overstated claims

## Framework Analysis

### libgpiod: The Universal Standard

#### ✅ Verified Strengths

1. **Official Linux Kernel Standard**
   - Maintained by Linux kernel developers
   - Uses character device interface (`/dev/gpiochip*`) introduced in kernel 4.8+
   - Documented in official kernel documentation
   - **Source**: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/gpio/

2. **Kernel-Enforced GPIO Exclusivity**
   - When a GPIO line is requested, kernel prevents other processes from claiming it
   - Quote from Raspberry Pi whitepaper: "One related feature of libgpiod is that it guarantees exclusivity whilst the GPIO is claimed, which none of the other libraries do."
   - **Source**: https://pip-assets.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-app-notes-guides-whitepapers/documents/RP-006553-WP/

3. **Universal SBC Support**
   - Works on any Linux SBC with GPIO chardev driver
   - Not Raspberry Pi-specific
   - Tested on: Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Rock Pi, Odroid, NanoPi
   - **Source**: https://hub.libre.computer/t/how-to-use-libgpiod-on-libre-computer-boards/73

4. **Future-Proof Architecture**
   - Uses kernel interface (not direct register access)
   - Will work on all future Raspberry Pi models
   - Already works on Pi 5 with RP1 I/O controller

#### ⚠️ Important Caveats

1. **GPIO State Persistence**
   - By default, GPIO lines may revert to default state on process exit
   - Raspberry Pi requires `dtparam=strict_gpiod` in `/boot/config.txt` for persistence
   - This is different from lgpio/pigpio/WiringPi behavior
   - **Source**: https://pip-assets.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-app-notes-guides-whitepapers/documents/RP-006553-WP/

2. **Threading Architecture**
   - No documented "zero-thread" guarantee
   - More accurate: Uses direct `ioctl()` calls without background thread management for basic GPIO
   - Event monitoring requires application-managed polling

3. **GPIO Only**
   - libgpiod handles GPIO only (not I2C/SPI/PWM)
   - Must use separate libraries for other protocols

4. **API Version Confusion**
   - Two major versions (v1.x and v2.x) with different APIs
   - Can be confusing for newcomers
   - Platform framework detects version and defines appropriate macros

#### 🎯 Best Use Cases

- System services and daemons (predictable resource cleanup)
- Multi-SBC projects (not just Raspberry Pi)
- Production deployments requiring reliability
- Projects needing guaranteed GPIO exclusivity
- Portable code across different Linux ARM platforms

---

### lgpio: The Raspberry Pi Convenience Framework

#### ✅ Verified Strengths

1. **Multi-Protocol Support**
   - GPIO, I2C, SPI, PWM, UART in one library
   - Consistent API across all protocols
   - Convenient for prototyping and development

2. **Raspberry Pi Support (All Models)**
   - Works on Pi 1-5
   - Created by Joan (pigpio's author) as successor
   - Well-maintained and actively developed

3. **GPIO State Persistence**
   - Maintains GPIO state after process exit by default
   - No special configuration required
   - Matches behavior users expect from pigpio/WiringPi

4. **Good Documentation**
   - Clear API documentation at http://abyz.me.uk/lg/lgpio.html
   - Examples available
   - Active community support

#### ⚠️ Important Caveats

1. **Threading Behavior**
   - Documentation mentions "start and stop new threads" for callbacks/alerts
   - Specific number of threads ("3-7") is anecdotal, not officially documented
   - Anecdotal user reports of shutdown delays in LibreELEC/Kodi contexts
   - **Sources**:
     - Ubuntu manpages: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man3/lgpio.3.html
     - LibreELEC forum: https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread/26953-rpi5-shutdown-delay/

2. **Raspberry Pi Focused**
   - Primarily tested and documented for Raspberry Pi
   - May work on other SBCs but less documented
   - Less portable than libgpiod

3. **No Kernel-Enforced Exclusivity**
   - Multiple processes can potentially access same GPIO
   - User must manage conflicts manually

#### 🎯 Best Use Cases

- Raspberry Pi-specific projects (all models including Pi 5)
- Projects needing multiple protocols (GPIO+I2C+SPI+PWM+UART)
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Single-library convenience over maximum portability
- Projects where state persistence is important

### pigpio: Legacy High-Performance (DEPRECATED)

#### Status: ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Keep for Legacy Support Only

**Quote from pigpio's author (Joan)**:
> "pigpio does not work on the Pi 5, I do not think it can be made to work. lgpio will work."

**Source**: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=373963

#### Key Facts

1. **Raspberry Pi 5 Incompatible**
   - Pi 5's RP1 I/O controller broke direct register access
   - No Pi 5 support planned by author
   - Will NOT work on future Raspberry Pi models

2. **Unique Features** (Pi 1-4 only)
   - Microsecond timing precision via DMA
   - Hardware-timed PWM on any GPIO pin
   - Waveform generation
   - Built-in servo control

3. **Daemon Architecture**
   - Requires `pigpiod` daemon for multi-process access
   - More complex setup and management

#### 🎯 When to Keep Using

- **LEGACY PROJECTS ONLY**
- Existing code on Pi 1-4 that can't be migrated
- Projects requiring unique DMA timing features
- **NOT RECOMMENDED for new projects**

---

### WiringPi: Legacy Only (NOT RECOMMENDED)

#### Status: ❌ DEPRECATED - Avoid for New Projects

1. **Deprecated Since 2019**
   - Original author (Gordon Henderson) discontinued project
   - GC2 fork provides maintenance but incomplete Pi 5 support
   - Not in official Raspberry Pi OS repositories

2. **Pi 5 Support Incomplete**
   - GC2 fork added basic Pi 5 support
   - GCLK function broken on Pi 5
   - Quote: "GCLK functionality is not supported due to RP1 chip documentation limitations"

3. **No Cross-Compilation**
   - Must build directly on Raspberry Pi
   - Cannot cross-compile from macOS/Linux desktop

4. **Architectural Issues**
   - Bypasses kernel GPIO management
   - Can cause conflicts with modern drivers
   - Confusing pin numbering (WiringPi/BCM/Physical)

#### 🎯 When to Keep Using

- **MAINTENANCE OF LEGACY CODE ONLY**
- Projects already using WiringPi that can't be migrated immediately
- **PLAN MIGRATION to libgpiod or lgpio**

## Decision Rationale

### Why Dual-Framework Approach?

Different projects have different requirements:

| Requirement | Recommended Framework | Why |
|-------------|----------------------|-----|
| Universal SBC support | libgpiod | Works across all Linux ARM SBCs |
| Raspberry Pi only | lgpio or libgpiod | Both work, lgpio adds multi-protocol convenience |
| System daemon | libgpiod | Kernel-enforced cleanup, predictable behavior |
| Multi-protocol needs | lgpio | All protocols in one library |
| Maximum portability | libgpiod | Official Linux standard |
| Rapid prototyping | lgpio | Single library, less setup |
| Production deployment | libgpiod | Future-proof, official standard |

### Why Not "One Framework to Rule Them All"?

1. **libgpiod** provides maximum portability but is GPIO-only
2. **lgpio** provides convenience but is Raspberry Pi-focused
3. Users benefit from having both options with clear guidance
4. Real-world projects have different priorities (portability vs. convenience)

### Positioning Strategy

**Tier 1: Recommended for New Projects**
- **libgpiod** → Production, daemons, multi-SBC, maximum portability
- **lgpio** → Raspberry Pi convenience, multi-protocol, rapid development

**Tier 2: Legacy Support**
- **pigpio** → Pi 1-4 only, migration to lgpio recommended
- **WiringPi** → Maintenance only, migration to libgpiod recommended
